# Introduction

This is a collection of notes I compiled while working on my Kerbal Space Program controller. While I did my best to make the information as simple as possible, this book isn't aimed at total beginners. If you find any areas that could use an improvement, please open a Pull Request or create an Issue with your suggestions.

The controller uses custom build PCBs containing STM32L4 chips. It communicates with various IO devices by using SPI, UART and CAN. The software is built on baremetal using no libraries.
